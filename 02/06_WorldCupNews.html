            The biggest in history of the <strong>FIFA World Cup</strong> qualifiers - and indeed in the history of
        international football - was recorded on 11 April 2001, when Australia beat American Samoa 31-0.
        </p>

        <p>
            The legendary match also brought global renown for <em>Archie Thompson</em>, whose 13-goal haul set a new world
        record, which stands to this day, for an individual player in a single international match.

        <p>
            And though the defeat earned American Samoa ignominy, so inspiring has their subsequent recovery been
        that it is now the subject of an acclaimed documentary, '<em>Next Goal Wins</em>', showing across the world.
